                <h3 class="red">Discovered by / at:</h3>
                <p>Dr. Enoim, a ramdom evening</p>

                <h3 class="green">Family:</h3>
                <p>Irradia doesn't have a family. Actually, she randomly pops out from Dr. Enoim's mind, and is
                    constantly seeking a sense of belonging, a shelter, but she is never satisfied.</p>

                <h3 class="green">Appearance:</h3>
                <p>Irradia resembles the human eye, with layers of skin that mimic the iris, each one uniquely distinct.
                    She pulses, revealing the rhythm of her heartbeat and breath.</p>

                The name Irradia, derived from the Latin word "irradiare" meaning "to shine," symbolizes the inner
                light that radiates through emotions. It represents the clarity that emotional awareness brings,
                illuminating and healing through emotional strength.
                Irradia is a collection and abstraction of the eyes that Dr. Enoim has deeply gazed into over the years.
                'I find human eyes incredibly captivating,' Dr.Enoim explains. 'They unknowingly reveal emotions that
                words often fail to express, and they rarely lie.' It was this fascination that led to the creation of
                Irradia. 'She embodies that honesty,' Dr.Enoim continues. 'Irradia is a reflection of pure sincerity, an
                entity born from the very essence of truth that lies hidden within the human gaze.'
                <br>
                <span class="yellow">Guidelines for human interaction with Irradia</span> According to Dr.Enoim, Irradia
                is curious however timid. It moves around randomly and slowly, and somehow reluctantly but sensitively
                reacts to humans' interaction. If you put your hands near it or drag it, it will drift towards you, but
                very slowly. But when you take your hand away, it will change its appearance as a way of defence. She
                does, however, welcome the opportunity to show you different versions of herself when you use a remote
                controller, as it allows her the space to introspect.
